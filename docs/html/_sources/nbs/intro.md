# Books with Jupyter book - A slim introduction

In this "book" we describe how to create a book using [jupyter book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) and publish is on github.


I should not call it a "book" because my idea is to quickly reach a useable state in which one focus on content creation (i.e. write your book) instead of explaining details of the setup, library, etc.

Hence you will often see code snippets and less text.

However I hope its as useful for you as its for me.
My personal intention is, that I like to look up basics quickly after not using a tool for quite some time.

## Alternative

Instead of using jupyter books I like to recommend [quatro](https://quarto.org/), because of some nice features like live-rendering,... .
